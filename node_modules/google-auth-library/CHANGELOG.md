## v2.0.0

Well hello 2.0 ðŸŽ‰  **This release has multiple breaking changes**.   It also has a lot of bug fixes.

### Breaking Changes

#### Support for node.js 4.x and 9.x has been dropped
These versions of node.js are no longer supported.

#### The `getRequestMetadata` method has been deprecated
The `getRequestMetadata` method has been deprecated on the `IAM`, `OAuth2`, `JWT`, and `JWTAccess` classes.  The `getRequestHeaders` method should be used instead.  The methods have a subtle difference:  the `getRequestMetadata` method returns an object with a headers property, which contains the authorization header.  The `getRequestHeaders` method simply returns the headers.

##### Old code
```js
const client = await auth.getClient();
const res = await client.getRequestMetadata();
const headers = res.headers;
```

##### New code
```js
const client = await auth.getClient();
const headers = await client.getRequestHeaders();
```

#### The `createScopedRequired` method has been deprecated
The `createScopedRequired` method has been deprecated on multiple classes.  The `createScopedRequired` and `createScoped` methods on the `JWT` class were largely in place to help inform clients when scopes were required in an application default credential scenario.  Instead of checking if scopes are required after creating the client, instead scopes should just be passed either into the `GoogleAuth.getClient` method, or directly into the `JWT` constructor.

##### Old code
```js
auth.getApplicationDefault(function(err, authClient) {
   if (err) {
     return callback(err);
   }
  if (authClient.createScopedRequired && authClient.createScopedRequired()) {
    authClient = authClient.createScoped([
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform'
    ]);
  }
  callback(null, authClient);
});
```

##### New code
```js
const client = await auth.getClient({
  scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform']
});
```

#### The `refreshAccessToken` method has been deprecated
The `OAuth2.refreshAccessToken` method has been deprecated.  The `getAccessToken`, `getRequestMetadata`, and `request` methods will all refresh the token if needed automatically.   There is no need to ever manually refresh the token.

As always, if you run into any problems... please let us know!
